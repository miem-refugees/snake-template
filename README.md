# Python Repository Template (3.13)

## Overview

This repository template provides a basic structure for your Python
projects. It includes essential files and directories to ensure
consistency across all projects.

## Dependencies

The following libraries are required:

* Python 3.x
* `requests` library for API interactions
* `numpy` library for numerical computations

Optional dependencies include:
* `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis
* `scikit-learn` for machine learning tasks

## Folders and Files**

* `src/`: The source code directory, containing main.py and other Python
files.
* `tests/`: The test directory, containing test_main.py and other test
files.
* `data/`: A directory to store sample data or other external resources.
* `.gitignore`: A file specifying which files and directories should be
ignored by Git.

## Example Usage

To get started with this template, simply create a new repository and
replace the contents of src/main.py and tests/test_main.py with your own
code.
